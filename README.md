# Graph Metrics and Visualization

This project calculates various metrics and visualizes graphs for two datasets:

1. **Graph 1**: Bitcoin Alpha Trust Weighted Signed Network  
   Source: [Bitcoin Alpha](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-alpha.html)  

2. **Graph 2**: Email Network in a European Institution  
   Source: [Email-Eu-core](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Eu-core.html)

## Files
- **graph1.ipynb**: Contains the code to analyze and visualize metrics for the Bitcoin Alpha dataset.
- **graph2.ipynb**: Contains the code to analyze and visualize metrics for the Email-Eu-core dataset.
